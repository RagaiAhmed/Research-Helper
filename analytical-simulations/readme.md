# Analytical Simulations

Here I construct simulations based on what I study 

each folder contains a topic/model which I hope to make a simulation of, these simulations are based on analytical mathematical models (No randomness involved)
so you just give the starting conditions and you can extract every snapshot of states at any time t

Units are usually SI units, (it won't matter anyway but lets keep it understandable in our real world)
